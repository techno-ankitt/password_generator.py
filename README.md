# password_generator.py
Password Generator is a simple Python program that generates strong random passwords. It uses letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), and special characters (!, @, #, etc.) to create secure passwords of user-defined length. The program runs in a loop so that users can generate multiple passwords until they decide to exit.
